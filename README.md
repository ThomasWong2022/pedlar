Pedlar is an algorithmic trading platform for Python designed for trading events, competitions and sessions such as Algothons. It uses real time data from IEX and TrueFX. It aims to support trading multiple securities at a frequency up to a second. Bid and ask prices from the top of the orderbook are streamed. 


## Getting Started

To setup the agent a few parameters need to be set. 
pedlarurl: Web server to the Algosoc database which stores your trade records, currently it is hosted on AWS at 

maxsteps: Maximum number of steps to run the agent, it is recommended to set to not more than 2000.

tickers: List of tuples containing the assets to be traded. Each tuple represents an asset which its exchange and ticker. 

(Optional)
truefxid, truefxpassword: User ID and passport for getting truefx premium data 


All you need to do is to implement a method which is called everytime when new data comes in. 
The methods take 4 arguments which contains all the information you need for making trade decisions at the time. 
history is a dataframe containing the most recent history index by exchange, ticker and time 
portfolio is a dataframe containing the current exposure of your agent on all assets 
orders is a dataframe contating the open orders of your agent
trades is a dataframe containing the completed trades of your agent

Refer to the csv files attached to have a better idea on how the trades and history are stored in pedlar

Currrently we have implemeted two methods to create and close orders. We support market orders only at the moment.

Future work:
Support different types of orders such as limit orders, stop losses and take profits.
Trade analysis integrated with alphalens and pyfolio
